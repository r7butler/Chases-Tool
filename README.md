# Chases-Tool
Our re-creation of Chase's tool to build the discrepancy report for the infauna data

The file called chasestool.ipynb is a jupyter notebook that has the code we are using along with line by line explanations, as well as the output that it gives.

The file called DiscrepancyReport.csv is the actual output from our python code re-creation of Chase's tool.

The file called Infauna_QC_B13_OCSD.xlsm is the original initial and QC Data used to build the report that we created. This excel workbook also contains the original output from Chase's actual tool that was built in excel (the 3rd tab, called Discrepancy Report)
