# Chases-Tool
Our re-creation of Chase's tool to build the discrepancy report for the infauna data

The file called ChasesTool.ipynb is a jupyter notebook that has the code we are using along with line by line explanations, as well as the output that it gives. Click on it to check it out.

The file called DiscrepancyReport-Python.csv is the actual output from our python code re-creation of Chase's tool. 
Again, you can just click on it and github will display it.

The file called Original_Data.csv is one of the dataframes we used to build the report.

The file called QC_Data.csv is the other dataframe we used to build the report.

The file called DiscrepancyReport-Original.csv is the original discrepancy report that was given to us and which was created by Chase's excel tool. It is also the same as the third tab of the Infauna_QC_B13_OCSD.xlsm excel workbook.
